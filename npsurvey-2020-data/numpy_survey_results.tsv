I’m regularly dealing with data structures for spherical harmonics, which naturally would be indexed with two indices, where one is always positive and the other is positive or negative, smaller in magnitude than the first. Similar to how a “normal” array is mapped to a linear index using stride[0]*idx[0] + stride[1]*idx[1], my data can be mapped to linear index using idx[0]**2 + idx[1].  Currently I have to choose between easy implementations using “normal” arrays which give me ease of indexing and broadcasting at the cost of storing a lot of zeros, and custom implementations using algorithms working directly on the linear stricture or wrapping them in classes. None of these two custom solutions give me access to the really nice broadcasting in numpy.  I realize that this is a massive change to how numpy works, but I think it could simplify quite a lot of scientific calculations in data structures which are not “rectangular”. 	1) If I google for some numpy function, all the top hits are referring to version 1.17 instead of the latest version, and there is no easy way to directly go to the latest version.  2) It is fairly common that I feel that the documentation only covers very simple examples, so the complicated usage is not obvious.

Many others (abs, angle, diff, sin, cos...) can only be used as functions. Sometimes it would be cleaner to write code with these as methods. 		No		Social media platform (Twitter, Facebook...)

IMO it is important for NumPy to maintain high performance to prevent ecosystem fragmentation with the introduction of many new array computation libraries (e.g. PyTorch).					Related to the above, I think one of the biggest concerns related to the scientific Python ecosystem (and, given it's position in that ecosystem, NumPy itself) is fragmentation of scientific Python computing tools as a result of the introduction of many new array libraries. It's not clear what more the NumPy community could be doing in this regard, and the work that is already being dedicated towards interoperability is very valuable. I would just like to reiterate the importance of this work and think the fragmentation of the ecosystem into multiple ecosystems based on different underlying array libraries would be detrimental to scientific Python as a whole.

The "documentation" and "learn" sections provide so many different places to start learning that I'm not sure where to direct new Python users. I understand this is being improved under NEP 44.					I like the plans in NEP 44. The current (1.20.dev0) "absolute basics" and "quickstart" tutorials repeat a lot of the same content, and could probably be consolidated. The "absolute basics" material has 26 section headings, which makes it hard to follow. I really like the way new front page of the website highlights the main concepts of "vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting" and then lists some of the subpackages than NumPy offers. Perhaps that's an outline that our intro docs could follow? I also wonder if multidimensional arrays should be introduced part-way through the new user tutorial so they can see some basic array operations sooner?

I don't consider myself knowledgeable enough on np's internals or development to really suggest specific plans for how to improve reliability, but I imagine that better documentation can help prevent users' from doing operations they don't realize are "unsafe". Also more built-in checking could be added, though of course this needs to be balanced against performance impact. As another enhancement that partly touches reliability, I would appreciate better support for missing data. This is a common cause of runtime errors that are not immediately noticed in development, both directly in my code and when passing data to other libraries. (I would especially appreciate missing data functionality that integrates well with pandas and similar parts of the ecosystem.)  Another very different idea would be to enhance support for static type checking, via offering a more official distribution of type annotations and eventually a full-featured type system such that checkers could enforce data types and shapes.			I feel that np has pretty good documentation out there, but it's often hard to *find* the right documentation for what you're looking for. For instance, there are often several functions that are closely related and it's hard to know which is the right one to use (it's even harder to remember without needing to look it up each time!). Perhaps additional ways to group together pieces of documentation with a high-level commentary that says "here's the one you should generally use unless you're in this case..." would help.

It always amazes me *how much numpy can do*. I only recently found out that there are financial functions included in the library.  I find it really hard to find most of these things out until I'm specifically looking for something, and then eventually find my way back into numpy through 3rd party platforms (e.g. StackOverflow telling me I should have been using numpy for this all along).

I know you'll never do it,but the matmul operator is nearly useless. I have no control as to whether the user passes in a matrix or scalar, and in many instances both are entire correctly. So my code is still only using dot. I've read the arguments of 'only one way' and it's bogus. We don't have different operators to add int int vs float float, nor should we. So I have dot(F, P).dot(Q) everywhere instead of F@P@Q. It is so hard to read, and prone to error (F.dot(P) can fail if F is not a matrix). I initially went through a bunch of code replacing dot with @ but had to get rid of them all because I was getting endless exceptions.

This would be especially useful for newer users (or even newcomers to Python!), and I think that a strong website would help showcase the functionality and utility befitting such a fundamentally useful tool!					As someone who has been introducing peers to using Python as a scientific tool, questions about NumPy are often raised (e.g. how to do particular things, "gotchas" when implementing specific functions, or more general interest in a "cookbook" of various minimal working examples of it being used). While the NumPy documentation (specifically, that available through the manual) goes some way to addressing this (especially as a quick reference for function arguments/outputs/references!), there is always room for improvement:  One particular aspect of this could be in the examples provided for "less trivial" examples where users may trip up on certain details in the implementation.  Another possibility could be adding additional sections to the "Explanations" and "How Tos" pages to cover common Q&As from e.g. Stack Overflow etc (although I see that this is only a fairly recent addition as per NEP 44, and look forward to seeing how it progresses!)

Some examples on reference pages are great, but some pages are missing them. Also, it would be excellent if the existing NumPy tutorials could be linked (as permalinks / versions) from the documentation when possible.  I'm thinking MATLAB-level documentation quality (which TBH is a high bar!).	Sugar - having to write out `np.asarray(my_list)` or `np.array([[...]])` is workable, but it would be nice to have something more compact so that math could stand out more. Perhaps making performant helper, like `A_(my_list)`, or `A_[[...]]`, might help? Then I could change `np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) @ np.array([10, 20])` as `A_[[1, 2], [3, 4]] @ A_[10, 20]`.  Scalars - the contract for scalars (np.array(()), np.generic, np.ndarray.item, etc.) has always thrown me off a bit. np.isscalar is also a bit confusing, i.e. people have to use `np.dim(x) == 0`, which feels awkward.  User dtypes: https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/c-info.beyond-basics.html#user-defined-data-types It would be nice if there were a concise overview of different ways of doing custom dytpes (e.g. dtype=object, structured dtypes, user dtypes). I've always felt like writing this out whenever I comment in issues, so it'd be nice to have good docs for this, and references back to this section. As far as the feature goes, it would also be nice if ctors / dtors worked for non-POD data (issue 10721).  Records / recarrays - these always confuse me in how I need to construct them and use them. TBH, MATLAB's struct arrays were also confusing, but did feel more cohesive (and simple) to me. Overall, it would be nice if there were a way to remove the need for one of the types, and then try to make attribute access less leaky (e.g. if I define a field like "size" which conflicts with the builtin property). Also, there aren't docs for examples of records linked from `np.record`s page: https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.record.html#numpy.record	No	No			No			Other (please specify)	2 cycles for common feature, 1 release for others	Contract Simplification (mainly the sugar side of things)	More cohesion? - "one right way to do things" (scalars), actually removing np.matrix, better support for @, etc.	Yes	Toyota Research Institute	Social media platform (Twitter, Facebook...)

If you are not very careful about types, unnecessary copying occurs. Although NumPy usually allocates C-style arrays, having a guarantee ahead of time (when creating the first array) would avoid help avoid excessive memory usage.			Although not really anyone's fault, old deprecated commands (especially on the SciPy documentation) are everywhere. Streamlining the numpy.random documentation to clarify trade-offs would be helpful. I also think that many beginner's are unaware of a lot of the many useful commands, so having some easy way to find new commands (like numpy.roll) would be great. There have been many times that I have written code one way, then learned of a superior (cleaner / more performant) way a year later. I think the numpy.where command is a good example.

I actually think your documentation is very good, especially when combined with stack overflow answers. But I was required to pick something!		No	No			Yes	Other (please specify)	Used dask because it was larger-than-memory arrays of data :)	Not sure		I think your masked array implementation is kind of clunky. The relationship between the mask and the underlying data array can get confusing. In particular, the behavior of the fill value is confusing. Setting something to the fill value in the data array doesn't change the mask. Changing the mask doesn't seem to update the data array. It's been a while since I've had to deal with this issue, but it can get confusing.		Not sure		Other (please specify)	SciPy!

A challenge has been to profile large programs using numpy. 				Some features such as __array_function__ or __array_ufuncs__ are poorly documented for more complicated use cases. While the documentation is fine to provide a simple understanding, to get a more complete understanding I read full implementations from dask or cupy.  Also some less ``mainstream'' interfaces sometimes lack examples that would greatly facilitate the meaning of options. A recent example that comes to mind is lgmres (can't think of a numpy right in this instance).		Yes	No			No			Depends on the feature				Not sure		Social media platform (Twitter, Facebook...)

I find it difficult to write code that can accept a single float as well as a numpy array, often getting type errors. I also have cases where the code may bifurcate in behaviour into two cases. In these cases I have to compute difference things and store them in different parts of the array, which is a quite manual process. Possibly I don't know all the features that are already there! 	I will first say that in my view numpy is a gold standard in self-generated documentation and everyone involved in the project should be very proud of the state of the documentation. I have found some cases where more examples would be useful. I have a background in numerical physics and I find some of the documentation of complex numerical algorithms to be lacking, although the only examples I can think of now are in scipy. Where a complex numerical algorithm is concerned I don't think it is enough to document the API. There are always limitations and edge cases where the algorithm will not perform well, or could even return incorrect results. The documentation could do more on this front.

The NumPy documentation is already excellent. The only problem I have is that it sometimes feels hard to figure out all the features that exist. I am not sure how to overcome this exactly.

I think that the documentation could be improved with an informal style guide that helps new and old users sort out what the 'modern' NumPy way is.  An alternative (if a style guide would be too contentious) is to provide a collection of examples of 'modern' NumPy being used to accomplish common tasks and avoid gotchas.  For example, a linear algebra collection might include examples of the use of 1d/2d ndarrays as opposed to the outdated matrix type, the use of @ as opposed to np.dot, etc.	Because there seems to be no plan for a NumPy Version 2, I think that a roadmap and timeline to consolidate and clean up the NumPy API would be very helpful.

It is good, but sometimes it can be hard to find functions that I suspect that NumPy has. The doctrees have been greatly improved but drilling down to the functions can be confusing.   Additionally, lots of functions have good details if you are an expert in the topic but are not so good if you are not. A good example is the filter design functions. scipy.signal.butter has an argument called "analog" it's description is unhelpfully "When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is returned." What is the difference? why might I care?  The code samples for scipy.signal.butter are another good example, they use the library very differently than I might when I use it. (this is more typical: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12233959/4492611)  This is not to say that the docs are not excellent, they are just the main way that I interact with NumPy and the topic I care the most about.

As it's quite a large and mature project, it can be tricky to know where to start with it and how much of say the Python C-API it's necessary to know about to feel comfortable.  It's maybe too much work for someone to do but what I've found amazingly useful in the past are guides where someone builds up a 'minimal version' of a project so you can see the core of the library (like this fort SQLite https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) - it's something I thought about trying to do with Numpy at some point (just the core array structure, no linear algebra etc) 		No	No			No			2 release cycles		Nothing obvious comes to mind, have always been able to do what I needed with it	N/A	Not sure		Social media platform (Twitter, Facebook...)

I don't have a suggestion off the top of my head as far as numpy is concerned. I find most of the error messages I usually encounter are very helpful and I rarely find myself scratching my head over some error that looks unrelated to what I'm actually trying to do. That said, I do believe that issues related to user experience should be given a very high priority as numpy is the core package that everyone uses in my branch (astrophysics) and its behaviour inspires many lesser developers who need an example for excellence.			Most functions have excellent documentation and I can tell that there's a lot of attention given to docstrings. Some functions however lack a single application example. Sometimes I get a much quicker grasp on a function by just looking at the examples as opposed to reading through verbose descriptions of the numerous arguments. Especially in cases I don't even end up using the function, it is much less frustrating when there are examples so that I immediately see that it is not what I'm looking for.

As an astronomer, it’s annoying to switch between Numpy and Astropy capabilities sometimes, so as a user, it would be really nice to see some more interplay with the two packages. But I think that’s more on them than y’all honestly. 				Learning how to use any package can be a barrier to new up and coming programmers. Well documented stuff can allow people to break into the field. More peers is good!! I find myself on the same 5-10 documentation pages every day because genfromtxt or whatever just doesn’t have the most intuitive documentation, so I have to reread the wording exactly.

I also found that if i happen to be stuck with a numpy array with the object dtype (a large array was saved within a list of lists) then it can get pretty messy to go back to ndarray. I had to recursively call np.vstack on the sub-arrays, even though everything was a float.			Including more use/edge cases in the docs as examples, possibly drawing from common uses in stack overflow, for instance.

People not efficiently using NumPy so that they think NumPy is too slow, just because their code is not optimized. This is why documentation and presenting the most optimized solutions is so important.  2. I tried messing around with CuPy and I had some graphic card issues, so my experience is limited, but is it crazy or out of scope to want GPU support in NumPy for some things? 				While I do like the documentation and I'll be honest, I should probably look at it more than just messing about or defaulting to stackoverflow (so take my words with a grain of salt!), I think as I stated to the previous question, really focusing on how people can work optimally with NumPy and not just what the features are would be amazing.

The other main thing is that the provided examples for many functions are unhelpful — either do not align with how most people will be using the function, are not sufficiently commented to be explanatory, and do not have descriptive variable naming. While generality and simple examples are great, there are many cases within the documentation where an example can be improved significantly by having a slightly more realistic use case demonstrated (or even better, several).

The documentation was thin and it would be good to offer some advice regarding the fact that the pip/conda versions are only targeted to the base x86_64 instructions and should be avoided if performance is important. Intel-numpy is a workaround but it's not mentioned in the numpy docs and a more general statement in the numpy docs would be more helpful imo (for any x86/arm/etc vendor)		Numpy docs are completely functional and do the job. However, between the time the numpy project began and now better documentation solutions have come online. Numpy docs have a strange previous/next topic interface that don't make sense without context. A full featured scroll able table of contents on the left (a la readthedocs) and even better fonts (I'm always bothered by the main function font and spacing with the black/yellow contrast).   My personal favorites for how documentation could look like would be Julia and Bokeh.
